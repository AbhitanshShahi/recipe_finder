This project is built purely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

* **Dynamic Results:** Fetches data from a recipe API and displays the results on the page without reloading.

* **(Suggestion):** *Add more features here as you build them, such as "View recipe instructions," "Filter by category," or "Save favorite recipes."*

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the web page.
* **CSS3:** For styling the application and making it responsive.
